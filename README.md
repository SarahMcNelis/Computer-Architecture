# Computer-Architecture Project

This repositary contains a project I completed for my Computer Architecture Module as part of my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics. 

<br>

## Overview
This project requried me to complete a two-part series of questions. 

- Q1 - Binary Arithmetic: Using rules of truth tables to perform arithmetic operations

- Q2 - Linux Assignemnt: Use a Linux terminal to create a shell script of commands, output those commands to a txt file and write a shell script creeating a maths table. 

<br>

## Repository contents
In this repository you will find the following:

- `CATC_Project_SarahMcNelis.docx` : this contains my answers including research and references used to complete both sections of the projet. 

- `Project Spc.pdf` : contains the lecture's specification for this project. 

- `question2.2_shell_script.sh` : this contains the shell script which I complete for q2.2 of the project. 

- `sarahMcnelis.txt` : this contains the output required for q2.2 of the project. 

<br>

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to understand the concept of Binary Arithmetic. And I was about to use a Linux terminal via a Virual Machine (VM) to complete linux commands and scripts. I have also shown my ability to research and explain concepts as required for this project.
